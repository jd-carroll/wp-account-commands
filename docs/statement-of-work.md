# Statement of Work
We are building a WordPress blog and newsletter where the subscribers are able to interact with the authors through comments on the blog posts. (A very standard use case.) Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any set of plugins which creates the sign-up and account management flow I would like.

<The ask>
<Here are the shortcodes & pages needed>
<There are also basic admin console requirements>

<Detailed documentation>

Further documetnation can be found for each page...
