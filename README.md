# WP Account Commands
This repository captures all of the documentation for a custom WordPress user management solution. It is intended to be used in collaboration with a Fiverr engagement to architect and develop a plugin based on these requirements.  

### Documentation
All documentation is located under the `docs` folder, including the primary [Statement of Work](./docs/statement-of-work.md) which describes the scope of the project. If there are any question on the requirements, please send a message in Fiverr.

##### Requirements
The documentation includes [Draw.io](https://draw.io) diagrams, it is assumed you know how to open these documents. If you do not know how to open a Draw.io diagram, please send a message asking for details, happy to help.

### Final Output
The final output for the engagement will be the code for a new plugin. The code for this plugin **should be committed here** and then a final zip of this repository will be uploaded into Fiverr as the final artifact of the engagement.

### Collaborative Engagement
I view this as a collaborative engagement. Meaning I would like to participate in your development process as a code reviewer. Prior to the start of the engagement we can agree on a code review frequency based on your preference. *(Note: The code review is not an attempt to micro-manage but a true collaborative attempt to ensure I have documented everything in my head in a way that makes sense.)*
